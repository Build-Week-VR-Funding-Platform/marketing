                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>SIXR is a non-profit tech organization based in Seattle, comprised of a group of motivated individuals who want to help the world succeed in reaching their dreams!</p>
                <p>We help underrepresented groups who wouldn’t otherwise have access to technology. For example, we empower minorities to build virtual reality experiences to tell their story, which fosters empathy and understanding. We want to build a platform that provides tech entrepreneurs with limited resources access to business training, project capital raising, and mentoring.</p>
                <p>There are so many people in societies across the globe who don't currently have access to the vision that is virtual reality. We are here to change that.</p>
